# Decoupled Feature-Temporal CNN: Explaining Deep Learning-Based Machine Health Monitoring

This repo contains the code used in our ICSMD paper. The published version will be updated soon. The motivation behind our research is trying to make "machine doctor" act as the real doctors who not only make diagnosis, but also provide symptoms. 

Implementation of our proposed **DE**coupled **F**eature-Temporal CNN (DEFT-CNN)
