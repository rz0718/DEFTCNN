# Decoupled Feature-Temporal CNN: Explaining Deep Learning-Based Machine Health Monitoring

This repo contains the code used in our ICSMD paper. The published version will be updated soon. The motivation behind our research is trying to make "machine doctors" act as the real doctors who not only make diagnosis, but also describe patients' symptoms. Our proposal algorithms will generate the saliency map to explain which parts of our input features contribute to the classification of machine condition.

Implementation of our proposed **DE**coupled **F**eature-Temporal CNN (DEFT-CNN)
